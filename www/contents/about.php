<h2> About Aude </h2>

<p>
   This program was started as a personal project around November 2012. The main
   goal was to get to understand automata and related algorithms, and also help
   friends in their revisions, in the hope more people, teachers included, would
   find it useful.
</p>
<p>
   A big part of Aude was written during an internship in summer 2013 at
   Verimag, supervised by Yliès Falcone (from the LIG Laboratory) and paid by
   Université Joseph Fourier, Grenoble.
</p>
<p>
   Since then, Aude is continued during my spare time, in coordination with
   Yliès' lessons at UJF.
</p>
<p>
   In September 2015, the user interface was refreshed. More notably, the old
   custom scripting language based on the Javascript syntax to write Aude's
   algorithms was dropped in favor of a new syntax, closer to pseudo code
   language. We were also given the permission from the University to release
   Aude as a Free Software.
