Aude (http://automata.forge.imag.fr/) is a free (as in free speech and in free beer) software to teach and experiment with automata.

What is a finite state automaton?
---------------------------------

   An a finite state automaton is a mathematical object behind regular expressions and robots. More precisely, we can define a finite state automaton as a quintuplet composed of:

    - Q     : a set of states
    - Sigma : a set of symbols
    - q0    : an initial state
    - Delta : a set of transitions, a transition being a (state, symbol, state) triplet.
    - F     : a subset of Q in which states are considered accepting / final

What does this program do?
--------------------------

   This program let the user write, draw or represent automata, run or write automata/set-related algorithms. To write algorithms, a convenient language strongly inspired of Javascript has been designed: Audescript. This language as native support for automata and sets. Sets have their own dedicated notation and the language defines common set operations as operators such as minus, inter, union and allow set iteration thanks to a foreach structure. But you don’t have to write algorithms: Aude comes with a set of predefined algorithms commonly found in lectures about finite state automata.

   In the near future, it should be possible to run a automaton on a word and follow the execution graphically, find a regular expression from an automaton and a automaton from a regular expression, and even more.

How do I run the program?
-------------------------

   Just open "index.html" in a recent browser.

   Supported browsers are:
    - The last version of Firefox (22+)
    - The last version of Google Chrome / Chromium (28+)
    - The last version of Opera (15+)
    - A recent version of Rekonq or any other browser that makes use of Webkit

   Should work on:
    - a recent version of Safari

   Might work on:
    - IE 10+, but this is untested

   Should not work on:
    - tablets

   Will probably never work on IE < 10.

Running Audescript programs outside of the browser?
---------------------------------------------------

    This is possible if you have node.js installed on your system. It was only tested on Linux so far. Run:

    $ ./audescript yourprogram.ajs parameters...

    If you installed aude in your system, you can run

    $ audescript yourprogram.ajs parameters...

	Audescript can also act as an interactive shell:

     $ ./audescript

    File redirections are also supported:

     $ ./audescript < file.ajs

    If you installed aude in your system (with make install for example), you can leave the "./" part.

Installing
----------

    Installing is not mandatory and it is only supported on Unix-like systems. It allows you to launch aude and audescript from any folder.
    If you want to install Aude, just type:

     $ sudo make install

    in the aude folder. Two programs are installed in /usr/local/bin: “aude” and “audescript“. If you want to install to somewhere else:

     $ DESTDIR=somewhere/else sudo make install

    make install will then put things in somewhere/else/bin and somewhere/else/share/aude.

    - To launch aude in firefox:
        $ BROWSER=firefox aude
    - To launch aude in chromium:
        $ BROWSER=chromium-browser aude
    - To launch audescript:
        $ audescript

    Opera version before 15 is not supported.
Unit tests
-----------

    Run:
     $ ./audescript tests/test.js

   This program was started as a personal project around November 2012. The main goal was to get to know automata and related algorithms, and also help friends in their revisions, in the hope more people, teachers included, would find it useful.
   As of July of 2013, however, most of the development was done during a stage at Verimag supervised by Yliès Falcone (from the LIG Laboratory) and paid by the Université Joseph Fourier, Grenoble.

What is the license of the program?
-----------------------------------

   Some parts are under a BSD license:
      set.js, automata.js, automatajs.js, automaton2dot.js ; these pieces of code are completely independent from other parts.

   Some parts are under a GPL 3+:
      index.html, automatagui.js, automatadesigner.js

   One file is under WTFPL (read the file's header for more information):
      mousewheel.js

   If you have doubts about a license to respect for a particular file, GPLv3+ is fine. You can also contact the author.
