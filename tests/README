aude.js is a prgramme that takes an audescript file in argument and executes it.
You can pass parameters to your audescript program by passing them to aude.js after your program's name.

Example:

   $ nodejs aude.js test.js

  This will run unit tests for audescript and some algorithms provided in the Aude package.
